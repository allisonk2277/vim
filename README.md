This repository contains my configuration for vim/MacVim/gvim.

To use this repository, remove your old configuration and then execute:
```
git clone https://github.com/dkong1796/vim.git ~/.vim
~/.vim/install.sh
```
The install script removes your old .vimrc and .gvimrc and replaces them with soft links into the .vim directory. It also installs Vundle and all included plugins automatically.
